# symfony-fundamentals
This repository is meant to be cloned! Since starting a new symfony project always takes time
doing the same things over and over again, I thought I share my latest symfony setup, so anyone (& espacially myself)
can clone this repository and will have this configuration.

Feel free to contribute when you miss things here!
